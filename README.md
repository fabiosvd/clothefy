Clothefy is a fictional online clothing store built by me using MERN Stack technologies. 

  -	Has different categories of clothing, the products displayed come from the database (MongoDB)
  -	Clicking on a product will take you to a page containing more information about it.
  -	The customer can add different products to the cart, change the quantity and remove them.
